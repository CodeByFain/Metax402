# MetaPay402, Meta Payment Processing via X402

## üß© Overview

### Why MetaPay402?

Traditional APIs rely on subscriptions or API keys. MetaPay402 replaces those with an on-chain pay-per-use model. When a client or agent hits a paid endpoint:

The API returns HTTP 402 Payment Required.

The client pays on-chain.

The API verifies payment and grants access. All of this happens automatically, within ~200ms.

### Core Capabilities

- Instant Settlement: Solana transaction finality in milliseconds

- Micropayments: Pay as little as $0.001 per request

- No Accounts: No API keys, OAuth, or subscriptions

- AI-Native: Built for LangChain and LangGraph agents

- Cross-Chain Design: Solana-first, multi-chain ready

- Full SDKs: Python + TypeScript parity

## üß† How It Works

MetaPay402 introduces a simple yet powerful flow between clients, APIs, and blockchain verification:

This allows agents and APIs to communicate autonomously and securely, ensuring each transaction is verified, timestamped, and final before data access is granted.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

MetaPay402 is built around four primary layers:

Core Protocol Layer, Implements the X402 standard, including request validation, signature handling, and transaction verification.

Middleware Layer, Provides integrations for FastAPI (Python) and Express (TypeScript) for easy payment gating.

Client Layer, Handles automatic detection of 402 responses and executes Solana micropayments.

Agent Layer, Allows LangChain and LangGraph agents to autonomously interact with paid APIs, managing budgets and payment strategies.

## üîê Security

MetaPay402 ensures a secure, decentralized payment environment through:

On-chain Verification, Every payment is verified directly on Solana.

Nonce + Expiry Mechanism, Prevents replay attacks.

Private Key Safety, Wallet keys remain local and never transmitted.

Transaction Limits, Define maximum allowed payments per call.

HTTPS Enforcement, All endpoints must use secure transport.

Best practices include using hardware wallets in production, environment variables for sensitive credentials, and strict rate-limiting policies.
